<h3>Research Profile</h3>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Information Systems in the Built Environment](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/design-and-decision-support-systems/information-systems-in-the-built-environment) research group of [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl) in the Netherlands. My work is part of the [WILSON Horizon Europe Project](https://wilson-project.eu/), focusing on distributed data modelling and federated digital twinning for lifecycle data-driven sustainable operation and management of buildings and districts. I am supervised by [Dr. Ir.-arch. Pieter Pauwels](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/pieter-pauwels) and [Dr. Ir.-arch. Ekaterina Petrova](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/ekaterina-petrova).

I am very excited at the prospect of devoting my long-term career to such a dynamic, fast advancing field.</q></b>

<h3>Academic Background</h3>

I earned my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Department of Electronics Technology](https://vik.bme.hu/) of the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/en) in Budapest, Hungary, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Balázs Villányi](https://www.ett.bme.hu/villanyi_balazs/en). My doctoral research was carried out in the [IPAR4 Lab (Industrial Product and Asset Management 4.0 Laboratory)](https://www.ipar4.bme.hu/), where I focused on the integration of [Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_internet_of_things) and [Industry 4.0 (I4.0)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution) technologies into enterprise systems. My doctoral thesis, titled [Research of Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 in Enterprise Resource Planning](https://repozitorium.omikk.bme.hu/server/api/core/bitstreams/3c063b02-672e-45a9-a525-614c0ef7b92a/content), explored smart manufacturing, predictive analytics, and industrial cyber-physical systems, with significant implications for advancing IIoT and I4.0 domains.

I received my M.Tech degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitp.ac.in/departments/engineering-technology/computer-science-and-engineering) from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna](https://iitp.ac.in) in India, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ashok Singh Sairam](https://fac.iitg.ac.in/ashok/view/index.php). My master's thesis focused on [Time Synchronization in Duty Cycled Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ravi33s.github.io/files/RAVI_CV.pdf), which was part of a DAAD-DST Indo-German collaborative project. The research aimed to model broadcast duration to ensure synchronization among wireless sensor nodes, with applications in industrial monitoring and networked systems. During this time, I also worked under [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Axel Sikora](http://ei.hs-offenburg.de/sikora) at [Offenburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-offenburg.de/) in Germany on an Indo-German Joint Research Collaboration.

<h3>Research overview</h3>

My research focusses on I4.0, IIoT, Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and computer networking. My work aims to reduce human intervention in data flow from industrial plants to ERP and cloud infrastructure by implementing cutting-edge techniques. My projects include secure query processing, sensor device integration, and trustworthy firmware dissemination.

Vision
------

I aim to contribute to a digitally integrated, sustainable, and human-centric industrial and built ecosystem, where data flows seamlessly across systems, decisions are informed by real-time insights, and technology serves both operational excellence and environmental stewardship.
