abstract: "The convergence of blockchain technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the metaverse presents transformative opportunities for creating secure, decen-tralized, and scalable infrastructures. This chapter explores how IoT serves as a foundational enabler for blockchain-enabled meta-verse systems, particularly in the context of smart wireless sensor networks (WSNs). IoT devices, ranging from edge sensors to industrial-grade equipment, generate vast amounts of real-time data that can be securely integrated into the metaverse using blockchain’s decentralized ledger capabilities. We discuss the role of IoT platforms like Azure IoT Central, Azure Digital Twins, and IoT Edge in bridging the physical and digital worlds, enabling real-time synchronization, analytics, and autonomous control within the metaverse. Furthermore, we examine how blockchain enhances security, trust, and transparency in IoT-driven metaverse ecosystems by ensuring immutable data transactions and decentralized governance. The chapter also highlights emerging paradigms such as digital twins, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven insights, and sustainable architectures that leverage blockchain to optimize resource utilization and scalability. Finally, we address challenges such as cross-chain interoperability, energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, and regulatory considerations for deploying IoT in blockchain-enabled metaverse infrastructures. Through case studies and technical insights, this chapter provides a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness the synergy of IoT and blockchain in shaping the future of the metaverse."
