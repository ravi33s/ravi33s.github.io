abstract: "Maintenance was essential during the industrial revolutions, and it has since been incorporated into the world of information technology. Due to the lack of strict regulations in the fields of maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), various participants use pre-implemented solutions available in the literature or as an open-source project to put together their solution based on their aspects and expectations. This paper provides a historical overview of maintenance as well as a comparison of the various types of maintenance. Then, based on the solutions available, we would like to summarize the machine learning algorithms and technologies that are currently in use for maintenance. Following that, we emphasized and demonstrated the importance of MRO, as well as how it can be applied in the fields of Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Finally, based on its benefits and features, we would like to detail frameworks and solutions that have successfully integrated the MRO approach or have the potential to do so."
