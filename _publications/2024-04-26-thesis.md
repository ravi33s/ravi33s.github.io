abstract: "The concept of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is a tangible building block for realising the fourth industrial revolution. It is expected to increase the productivity, efficiency, and dependability of industrial automation systems, resulting in increased revenue in industrial scenarios. The IIoT must incorporate multiple disciplines and technologies to create a functional and harmonious system. A reliable exchange of information is required for a system to exhibit such behaviour. The information lifecycle in industrial automation begins at the field level, with data collected by sensors, and ends at the enterprise level, where that data is processed into knowledge of business decision making. The process of knowledge discovery in IIoT is expected to begin in the lower layers of the automation hierarchy and to include data exchange between connected smart objects in order to perform collaborative tasks.<br><br>

In conclusion, this thesis shows that the underground ecosystem is diverse, and it is possible to identify and stealthily monitor the fraction that convincingly solves trade problems and drives innovation, thus obtaining more refined threat intelligence, while better understanding the criminal decision-making process. Ultimately, we argue that identifying factors that support innovation in the cybercriminal landscape has the potential to provide insights on the criminal’s decision making, hence allowing defenders to, potentially, be prepared for the `next big attack’ before it arrives."
