abstract: "The digitalization of the built environment faces challenges such as interoperability, standardization, integration of legacy systems and secure data exchange. The International Data Spaces (IDS) framework, used successfully in logistics and energy, enables organizations to create value through data. This paper examines how the Vocabulary Hub, a core IDS component, addresses these challenges in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) sector. It outlines the setup of a domain-specific vocabulary hub and analyzes its role in semantic data exchange, suggesting that IDS is a promising approach for data integration in federated digital twin systems and structured data sharing in AECO."
