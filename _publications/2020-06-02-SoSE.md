abstract: "Industrial sector advancement expedites large industrial data by leveraging new electro-mechanical and information communication technologies. This is an ascent towards fully automated smart industries. It brings new challenges, but also an opportunity to make industrial manufacturing entities and process part of internet. Due to the delay and security requirements, the flooding of industrial data performing local real time task should be restricted, and only business-relevant, structured data are to be transmitted. For achieving this, we have proposed a two-tier data management architecture based on content filtering. In this context, two different layers are used to process data locally and globally. Additionally, we also discussed a typical industrial automation stack, its underlying processes and relevant technologies. Finally, we touched some research challenges at the last section of this paper as opportunities towards achieving the goal of smart industries."
