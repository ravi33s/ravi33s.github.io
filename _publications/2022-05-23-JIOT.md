abstract: "Smart manufacturing systems (SMS) are one of the most important applications in the Industry 4.0 era, offering numerous advantages over traditional production systems and rapidly being used as a performance-enhancing strategy of manufacturing enterprises. A few of the technologies that must be connected to construct an SMS are the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Big Data, Robotics, Blockchain, 5G Communication, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and many more. SMS is an innovative and popular manufacturing setup that produces increasingly intelligent production systems; yet, designers must adapt to business tastes and requirements. This study employs an analytical and descriptive research technique to identify and assess functional and non-functional, technological, economic, social, and performance evaluation components that are essential to SMS evaluation. A predictive analytics framework, which is a key component of many decision support systems, is used to assess corporate needs as well as proposed and prioritize SMS services."
