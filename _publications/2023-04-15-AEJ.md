abstract: "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has captured the attention of various smart farming industries in recent years by connecting physical objects of smart farms over the internet so that they can be discovered and queried globally using Enterprise Application Software (EAS). This continuous transmission and processing poses a significant challenge in dealing with the massive amount of Big-Data being gathered and disseminated. As more applications use cloud platforms to increase storage capacity by storing Big-Data on an untrusted cloud server, data security precautions should be taken. However, with the rapid increase in the number of IIoT devices and EAS end-users and their diverse categories, the existing device authentication mechanisms in IIoT suffer from single factor authentication and poor adaptability. In light of the security requirements in IIoT Big-Data sharing using untrusted cloud servers, we present in this paper a sustainable Ethereum merge-based Big-Data gathering and dissemination in IIoT system. Extensive theoretical and simulation results validate data gathering with a business incentive mechanism with a proper data propagation threshold is an important parameter for determining equilibrium and analysing dynamic properties of IIoT system, which directly affects data processing speed and its final state. The Ethereum merge mechanism controls data dissemination instances in both the industry and EAS through classification and integrity verification using distributed authentication devices. Proof-of-stake is used for this purpose, which uses randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and add new ledgers to consortium blockchains to transfer data using partial secrets, making it fast, secure, and sustainable. Our proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes in simulation over Hyperledger Fabric with improved security measures."
