abstract: "With growing evolution in computing and communication technologies consolidated with the demand of supervising physical and environmental conditions gave rise to the expansion of Internet of Things(IoT). An Internet of Things is a wireless network comprising of diffused independent devices (Things in IoT) using sensors and actuators for monitoring and controlling of environment. It has been expected that trillions of such devices in coordination with billions of smart systems using millions of applications will be in use. The most of the internet traffic will be carried out by all such IoT devices in future. This brings up the challenges for diffused and cooperative computing and communication. The paper shows the road map and role of IoT as mother technology for the key of success for ongoing and future projects in India, such as clean and green India, smart city, high speed railway projects, pollution control systems, smart agriculture and many more."
