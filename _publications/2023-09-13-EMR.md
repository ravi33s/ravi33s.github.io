abstract: "This article investigates the transformative power of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), focusing specifically on the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to reshape industries and domains, ushering society into a new era of unprecedented progress. Contrary to popular belief—AI has the potential to replace humans; this study emphasizes the pivotal role of strategic responses in shaping outcomes. The importance of early AI adoption is emphasized, and businesses are classified as enablers, users, or ignorers of GPTs, revealing implications for success. Leveraging a compelling case study of the United Parcel Service, demonstrate the transformative power of AI effects on operational efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. My argument reframes AI as a superpower, urging active participation in this transformative era and recognizing its potential to amplify human capabilities. I investigate the proliferation of AI tools across professions, allowing individuals to harness AI as users or ascend as enablers, crafting tailored solutions for industries."
